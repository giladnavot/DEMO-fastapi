title: UserBase Class Overview
---
This document will cover the `UserBase` class from the `docs_src/extra_models/tutorial002.py` file in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We will discuss:

1. What is `UserBase`.
2. The variables and functions defined in `UserBase`.
3. An example of how `UserBase` is used in `UserIn`.

# What is UserBase

`UserBase` is a class that serves as a base model for user-related classes in the FastAPI application. It is used to define the common attributes that all user-related classes should have.

# Usage example

`UserBase` is used as a base class for `UserIn`. `UserIn` inherits all the variables from `UserBase` and adds a `password` variable.

```python
class UserIn(UserBase):
    password: str
```
