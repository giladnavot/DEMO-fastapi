# What is User

The `User` class is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate and serialize user data. The class includes fields for the username, email, full name, and a disabled status.

# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. `UserInDB` includes all the fields from `User` and adds a `hashed_password` field. This is an example of how the `User` class can be used to create more specific user models.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
