title: DEMO-fastapi overview
---
The DEMO-fastapi repository is a demonstration of the FastAPI framework. It's a high-performance Python framework used for building APIs. It provides examples of creating API endpoints, running the server, and using features such as validation, serialization, automatic documentation, and dependency injection.

### Compat

The 'compat' module is a compatibility layer for Pydantic. It provides a unified interface for different versions of Pydantic, abstracting away the differences and allowing consistent interaction with Pydantic across the codebase.

### Param functions

Param functions are a crucial part of FastAPI's request handling mechanism. They allow developers to declare and validate parameters in a type-safe manner, while also providing a way to specify additional metadata for the parameters. This makes it easier to build robust and error-free APIs.

### Routing

Routing is a fundamental aspect of any web application. It allows the application to respond to different URLs or paths, and HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). In FastAPI, routing is achieved using Python decorators that are applied to specific functions. These functions are then mapped to specific URLs or paths. When a request comes in, FastAPI uses the path and the HTTP method of the request to find the corresponding function (also known as a route handler or endpoint) to execute. FastAPI also provides dynamic routing, where parts of the URL can be processed as parameters, allowing for flexible and variable URLs.

### Openapi

OpenAPI is a specification that provides a standardized and language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs. It allows both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without direct access to the source code. In the context of the DEMO-fastapi repository, OpenAPI is used to automatically generate interactive API documentation, client SDKs, and other useful resources. The `get_openapi` function in the `fastapi/openapi/utils.py` file is a key part of this process, as it generates the OpenAPI schema for the API. This schema includes information about the API's paths, components, and tags, among other things. The `get_openapi` function relies on several other functions to generate the schema, including `get_openapi_path`, `get_openapi_operation_metadata`, and `get_openapi_operation_parameters`.

### Dependencies

In the context of FastAPI, dependencies are a set of tools that allow you to declare and manage components that can be reused across multiple endpoints. They are used to manage shared resources like database connections, authentication and authorization mechanisms, and more. Dependencies are declared using Python's type annotations and FastAPI's `Depends` function. They can be resolved automatically by FastAPI and can also be overridden for testing purposes. The `Dependant` class is used to represent a dependency, and the `solve_dependencies` function is used to resolve them.

### Applications

The FastAPI class is used to create instances of your application. It provides methods for defining request handling functions, known as 'path operations', for different HTTP methods and paths. These path operations can include parameters for path variables, query parameters, request bodies, and more. FastAPI uses these parameters, along with Python type annotations, to perform automatic request validation and serialization. It also uses this information to automatically generate API documentation using the OpenAPI standard. The FastAPI class also provides methods for adding middleware, exception handlers, and event handlers to your application.

### Security

Security in FastAPI is primarily handled through the OAuth2 protocol, with support for different flows and scopes. It also provides utilities for handling HTTP authorization and API keys. The `SecurityScopes` class is used to manage the OAuth2 scopes required by all dependencies in the same chain, allowing for different scopes even within the same path operation. The `OAuth2` class is the base class for OAuth2 authentication, with subclasses for each OAuth2 flow. It also provides an option for optional authentication, where the absence of an HTTP Authorization header does not automatically result in an error.

### Params

In the DEMO-fastapi repository, 'Params' are used to define the data that an API endpoint expects to receive. They are defined using classes such as 'Param', 'Query', 'Path', 'Header', 'Cookie', 'Form', 'File', 'Depends', and 'Security'. Each class represents a different type of parameter and has its own specific properties and behaviors. For example, 'Query' is used for parameters that are passed in the URL query string, while 'Path' is used for parameters that are part of the URL path. 'Depends' is used to express dependencies between parameters, and 'Security' is used for parameters related to security, such as API keys or tokens.
