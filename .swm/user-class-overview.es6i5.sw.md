# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. `UserInDB` inherits all the variables from `User` and adds an additional `hashed_password` variable. This is an example of how the `User` class can be used to create more specific user models.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str
```
