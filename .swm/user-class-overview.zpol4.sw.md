# What is the User class

The `User` class in the DEMO-fastapi repository is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate the data of a user and to create a structured user object that can be used throughout the application.

# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. The `UserInDB` class adds a `hashed_password` variable to the `User` class. This is an example of how the `User` class can be used to create more specific user models.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
