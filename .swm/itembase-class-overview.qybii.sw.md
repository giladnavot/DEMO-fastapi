# What is ItemBase

`ItemBase` is a class that serves as a base model for items in the application. It is defined using the Pydantic library's `BaseModel` class, which provides a way to validate data. `ItemBase` is used as a parent class for other classes in the application that need to inherit its properties.

# Usage example

`ItemCreate` is a class that inherits from `ItemBase`. It doesn't add any new properties or methods, meaning it has the same structure as `ItemBase`.

```python
class ItemCreate(ItemBase):
    pass
```
