# What is UserBase

The `UserBase` class is a Pydantic model that represents the base attributes of a user in the application. It is used as a base class for other user-related models, providing a common set of attributes for all user models.

# Variables in UserBase

The `email` variable is a string that stores the email of the user. It is the only attribute defined in the `UserBase` class.

```python
    email: str
```

# Usage example of UserBase

`UserBase` is used as a base class for the `UserCreate` class. `UserCreate` inherits the `email` attribute from `UserBase` and adds a `password` attribute.

```python
class UserCreate(UserBase):
    password: str
```
