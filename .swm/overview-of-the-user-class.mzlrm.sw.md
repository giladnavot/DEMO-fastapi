title: Overview of the User Class
---
This document will cover the `User` class in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We will discuss:

1. What the `User` class is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions defined in the `User` class.
3. An example of how to use the `User` class in `UserInDB`.

# What is User

The `User` class is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate and serialize user data. The class includes attributes such as `username`, `email`, `full_name`, and `disabled`.

# Variables in User

The `username` variable is a required string that represents the username of the user.

```python

The `email` variable is an optional string that represents the email of the user. It defaults to `None` if not provided.

```python
    email: str | None = None
```

# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. `UserInDB` inherits all the attributes of `User` and adds an additional `hashed_password` attribute. This shows how the `User` class can be used as a base class for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str
```
