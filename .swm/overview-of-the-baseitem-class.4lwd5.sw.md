# What is BaseItem

`BaseItem` is a class that serves as a base model for other classes in the application. It is defined using the `BaseModel` class from the `pydantic` library, which is a data validation library used to validate that the data structures (like JSON) match the expected models. `BaseItem` is used to define common attributes for other classes that inherit from it.

# Usage example

`CarItem` is an example of a class that extends `BaseItem`. It inherits the `description` and `type` variables from `BaseItem` and sets the `type` variable to 'car'.

```python
class CarItem(BaseItem):
    type: str = "car"
```
