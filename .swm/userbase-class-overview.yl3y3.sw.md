# What is UserBase

UserBase is a class defined in the `schemas.py` file of the DEMO-fastapi repository. It is a Pydantic model that represents the base properties of a user in the application. It is used as a base class for other user-related classes in the application, providing a common set of properties that all user classes should have.

# Variables in UserBase

The `email` variable is a string that stores the email of the user. It is the only property defined in the UserBase class.

# Usage example

UserBase is used as a base class in the UserCreate class. UserCreate extends UserBase and adds an additional `password` property. This shows how UserBase can be used to provide common properties for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserCreate(UserBase):
    password: str
```
