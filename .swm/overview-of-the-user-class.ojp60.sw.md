# What is User

The `User` class is a Pydantic model in the FastAPI framework. It is used to define the data structure for a user, including the username, email, full name, and disabled status. This class is used to validate the data of a user and to generate JSON Schema for responses, among other things.

# Variables in User

The `username` variable is a required string that represents the username of the user.

```python
    username: str
```

The `email` variable is an optional string that represents the email of the user. It defaults to `None` if not provided.

```python
    email: Union[str, None] = None
```

The `full_name` variable is an optional string that represents the full name of the user. It defaults to `None` if not provided.

```python
    full_name: Union[str, None] = None
```

The `disabled` variable is an optional boolean that represents whether the user is disabled. It defaults to `None` if not provided.

```python
    disabled: Union[bool, None] = None

# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. `UserInDB` inherits all the variables from `User` and adds an additional `hashed_password` variable. This shows how the `User` class can be used as a base class for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
