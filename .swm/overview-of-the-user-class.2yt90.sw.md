title: Overview of the User Class
---
This document will cover the User class in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We'll discuss:

1. What the User class is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions within the User class.
3. An example of how to use the User class in UserInDB.

# What is User

The User class is a Pydantic model in the FastAPI framework. It is used to define the structure of a user object, including the data types and default values. This class is crucial for data validation, serialization, and documentation in the API.

# Usage example

The User class is extended by the UserInDB class. UserInDB inherits all the variables from User and adds an additional `hashed_password` variable. This shows how the User class can be used as a base for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str
```
