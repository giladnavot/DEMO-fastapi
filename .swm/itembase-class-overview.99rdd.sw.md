# What is ItemBase

`ItemBase` is a class that serves as a base model for items in the application. It is defined using the Pydantic `BaseModel` and includes properties that are common to all items.

# Usage example of ItemBase

`ItemBase` is used as a base class for `ItemCreate`. This allows `ItemCreate` to inherit the `title` and `description` properties from `ItemBase`.

```python
class ItemCreate(ItemBase):
    pass
```
