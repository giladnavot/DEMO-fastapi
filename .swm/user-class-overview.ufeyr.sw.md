# What is User

The User class is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate the data of a user and to provide a clear model of what a user object should look like. It includes fields such as username, email, full_name, and disabled.

# Usage example

The User class is extended by the UserInDB class. This class adds a `hashed_password` variable to the User class. This shows how the User class can be extended to add more fields when needed.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str
```
