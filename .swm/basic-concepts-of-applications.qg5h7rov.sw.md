title: Basic Concepts of Applications
---
Applications in the DEMO-fastapi repository refer to the instances of the FastAPI class. They serve as the main entry point for using FastAPI. An application instance is created by declaring `app = FastAPI()`. This instance, `app`, is then used to define API endpoints, configure middleware, exception handlers, and more. It also holds the configuration details of the application such as the title, description, and version. The application instance is responsible for handling the lifecycle of a request, from receiving the HTTP request to sending the HTTP response.

# FastAPI Class

This is the definition of the FastAPI class, which represents an application. It includes various configurations like title, description, version, etc.

````python
class FastAPI(Starlette):
    """
    `FastAPI` app class, the main entrypoint to use FastAPI.

    Read more in the
    [FastAPI docs for First Steps](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/first-steps/).

    ## Example

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI

    app = FastAPI()
    ```
    """

    def __init__(
        self: AppType,
        *,
````

# Defining Routes

This is an example of how to define routes using the .add_api_route() method of the FastAPI instance. You can also use decorator methods like .get(), .post(), .put(), etc. to define routes.

```python
    def add_api_route(
        self,
        path: str,
        endpoint: Callable[..., Coroutine[Any, Any, Response]],
        *,
        response_model: Any = Default(None),
        status_code: Optional[int] = None,
        tags: Optional[List[Union[str, Enum]]] = None,
        dependencies: Optional[Sequence[Depends]] = None,
        summary: Optional[str] = None,
        description: Optional[str] = None,
        response_description: str = "Successful Response",
        responses: Optional[Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]]] = None,
        deprecated: Optional[bool] = None,
        methods: Optional[List[str]] = None,
        operation_id: Optional[str] = None,
        response_model_include: Optional[IncEx] = None,
        response_model_exclude: Optional[IncEx] = None,
        response_model_by_alias: bool = True,
        response_model_exclude_unset: bool = False,
        response_model_exclude_defaults: bool = False,
```

# Application Setup

This is the setup method of the FastAPI class. It is used to set up the application, including adding routes for the OpenAPI and ReDoc documentation.

```python
    def setup(self) -> None:
        if self.openapi_url:
            urls = (server_data.get("url") for server_data in self.servers)
            server_urls = {url for url in urls if url}

            async def openapi(req: Request) -> JSONResponse:
                root_path = req.scope.get("root_path", "").rstrip("/")
                if root_path not in server_urls:
                    if root_path and self.root_path_in_servers:
                        self.servers.insert(0, {"url": root_path})
                        server_urls.add(root_path)
                return JSONResponse(self.openapi())

            self.add_route(self.openapi_url, openapi, include_in_schema=False)
        if self.openapi_url and self.docs_url:

            async def swagger_ui_html(req: Request) -> HTMLResponse:
                root_path = req.scope.get("root_path", "").rstrip("/")
                openapi_url = root_path + self.openapi_url
                oauth2_redirect_url = self.swagger_ui_oauth2_redirect_url
                if oauth2_redirect_url:
```
