title: Overview of the User Class
---
This document will cover the 'User' class in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We'll cover:

1. What the 'User' class is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions defined in the 'User' class.
3. An example of how to use the 'User' class in 'UserInDB'.

# What is User

The 'User' class is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate and serialize user data. It includes fields for the username, email, full name, and a disabled status.

# Usage example

The 'User' class is extended by the 'UserInDB' class. 'UserInDB' inherits all the fields from 'User' and adds an additional 'hashed_password' field. This shows how the 'User' class can be used as a base for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
