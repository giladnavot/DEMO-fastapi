# Usage example

The 'User' class is used as a base class for the 'UserInDB' class. 'UserInDB' extends 'User' and adds a 'hashed_password' variable. This shows how you can extend the 'User' class to add more information for different use cases.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
