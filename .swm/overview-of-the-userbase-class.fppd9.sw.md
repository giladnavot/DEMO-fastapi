title: Overview of the UserBase Class
---
This document will cover the `UserBase` class from the `tutorial002_py310.py` file. We'll discuss:

1. What `UserBase` is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions defined in `UserBase`.
3. An example of how `UserBase` is used in `UserIn`.

# What is UserBase

`UserBase` is a class that serves as a base model for user-related classes in the application. It is used to define the common attributes that a user should have, such as username, email, and full name.

The `email` variable is of type `EmailStr` from the `pydantic` library, which validates that the input is a valid email string.

```python
    email: EmailStr
```

# Usage example

`UserBase` is extended by the `UserIn` class, which adds a `password` field to the base model. This shows how `UserBase` can be used as a foundation for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserIn(UserBase):
    password: str
```
