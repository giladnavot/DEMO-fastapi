# What is APIRoute

APIRoute is a class in FastAPI that is used to define a single API route. It is responsible for handling HTTP requests to a specific path, processing the request data, calling the appropriate endpoint function, and generating the response. It also handles route parameters, request bodies, and other details of the HTTP request.

# Variables and functions in APIRoute

The `path` variable is used to store the URL path for this route. It is a string that is provided when the APIRoute is created.

```python
    def __init__(
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/fastapi/routing.py" line="391">

---

The `endpoint` variable is the function that should be called when this route is matched. It is provided when the APIRoute is created.

```python
        self,
```

---

The `response_model_by_alias` variable is a boolean that determines whether the response model should use alias names.

```python
        response_model_include: Optional[IncEx] = None,
```

---

</SwmSnippet>

<SwmSnippet path="/fastapi/routing.py" line="408">

# Usage example

APIRoute is used internally by FastAPI and you generally do not need to use it directly. Instead, you define route functions using the FastAPI route decorators like `@app.get()`, `@app.post()`, etc. These decorators create instances of APIRoute for each route.
