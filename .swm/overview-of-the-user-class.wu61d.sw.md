1. What the `User` class is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions defined in the `User` class.
3. An example of how to use the `User` class in `UserInDB`.

# What is User

The `User` class in `docs_src/security/tutorial003.py` is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate and serialize user data.

# Usage example

The `UserInDB` class extends the `User` class and adds a `hashed_password` variable. This shows how the `User` class can be extended to add more attributes to a user.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str
```
