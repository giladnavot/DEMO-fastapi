title: Overview of the User Class
---
This document will cover the `User` class in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We'll cover:

1. What the `User` class is and its purpose.
2. The variables and functions defined in the `User` class.
3. An example of how to use the `User` class in `UserInDB`.

# What is User

The `User` class is a Pydantic model that represents a user in the application. It is used to validate the data of a user and to provide a clear model of what a user object should look like. It includes attributes such as `username`, `email`, `full_name`, and `disabled`.

# Variables in User

The `username` variable is a required string that represents the username of the user.

```python
    username: str
```

The `email` variable is an optional string that represents the email of the user. It can be `None`.

```python
    email: Union[str, None] = None
```

The `disabled` variable is an optional boolean that represents whether the user is disabled. It can be `None`.

# Usage example

The `User` class is extended by the `UserInDB` class. `UserInDB` includes all the attributes of `User` and adds the `hashed_password` attribute. This shows how the `User` class can be used as a base for other user-related classes.

```python
class UserInDB(User):
    hashed_password: str

```
