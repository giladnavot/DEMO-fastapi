This document will cover the `BaseUser` class. We'll cover:

1. What is `BaseUser`
2. Variables and functions in `BaseUser`
3. Usage example of `BaseUser`.

# What is BaseUser

`BaseUser` is a class that represents a user in the application. It is used to store and validate user information. It is a subclass of the `BaseModel` class from the `pydantic` library, which provides runtime data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.

# Usage example

`BaseUser` is used as a base class for the `UserIn` class. `UserIn` extends `BaseUser` and adds a `password` field. This shows how `BaseUser` can be extended to add more fields for different use cases.

```python
class UserIn(BaseUser):
    password: str
```

Here, `BaseUser` is used as the return type of the `create_user` function. This function takes a `UserIn` instance as input and returns a `BaseUser` instance. This shows how `BaseUser` can be used to define the input and output types of API endpoints.

```python
@app.post("/user/")
async def create_user(user: UserIn) -> BaseUser:
    return user
```
