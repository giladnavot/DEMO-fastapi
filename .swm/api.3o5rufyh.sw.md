title: API
---
This document will cover the process of using the API in the DEMO-fastapi repository. We'll cover:

1. An overview of what the API offers and some endpoints.
2. Where to find the list of endpoints.
3. How to use the API documentation tools available in the repo (e.g. Swagger, Postman).

## API Overview

The API in the DEMO-fastapi repository is built using the FastAPI framework. It is designed to provide high-performance, easy to use APIs with minimal setup. The API includes various endpoints for handling tasks such as user authentication, data retrieval, and data manipulation.

## Finding Endpoints

The list of API endpoints can be found in the OpenAPI schema generated by FastAPI. This schema is created in the `get_openapi` function in `fastapi/openapi/utils.py`. The schema includes information about each endpoint, such as the HTTP method, path, parameters, and response model.

```python
def get_openapi_path(
    *,
    route: routing.APIRoute,
    operation_ids: Set[str],
    schema_generator: GenerateJsonSchema,
    model_name_map: ModelNameMap,
    field_mapping: Dict[
        Tuple[ModelField, Literal["validation", "serialization"]], JsonSchemaValue
    ],
    separate_input_output_schemas: bool = True,
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Any], Dict[str, Any]]:
    path = {}
    security_schemes: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    definitions: Dict[str, Any] = {}
    assert route.methods is not None, "Methods must be a list"
    if isinstance(route.response_class, DefaultPlaceholder):
        current_response_class: Type[Response] = route.response_class.value
    else:
        current_response_class = route.response_class
    assert current_response_class, "A response class is needed to generate OpenAPI"
    route_response_media_type: Optional[str] = current_response_class.media_type
```

## Using Swagger

The API is available via Swagger. The Swagger UI provides an interactive documentation for the API. It allows you to explore all the API endpoints, and even send requests and receive responses directly from the UI.

## Using Postman

Currently, our project does not include a Postman collection in the repository. However, you can manually create a Postman collection for the API by importing the OpenAPI schema.
